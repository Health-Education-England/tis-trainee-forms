                programme:
              </dd>
            </div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I will always have at the forefront of my clinical and professional practice the
                principles of Good Medical Practice for the benefit of safe patient care. I am aware
                that Good Medical Practice requires me to keep my knowledge and skills up to date
                throughout my working life, and to regularly take part in educational activities
                that maintain and further develop my capabilities, competence and performance.
              </li>
              <li>
                As a doctor in training, I will make myself familiar with my curriculum and meet the
                requirements set within it. I will use training resources available optimally to
                develop my knowledge, skills and attitudes to the standards set by the relevant
                curriculum. This will include additional requirements as set out by the relevant
                curricula.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will ensure that the care I give to patients is responsive to their needs, and
                that it is equitable, respects human rights, challenges discrimination, promotes
                equality, and maintains the dignity of patients and carers.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will ensure I treat my clinical and non-clinical colleagues with respect,
                promoting a culture of teamworking across all professions working in healthcare.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will maintain my General Medical Council (GMC) registration with a licence to
                practise (even if temporarily out of programme). For all trainees, failure to do so
                may result in a police investigation, immediate exclusion from employment and
                referral to the GMC. Failure to do so may also result in my removal from the
                training programme.
              </li>
              <li>
                I understand my responsibilities within revalidation, that I must declare my full
                scope of practice (including locum positions) and that I will provide evidence for
                all areas of activity using the Form R part B to inform the ARCP panel and RO of the
                full scope of practice. I understand that my Responsible Officer is the Postgraduate
                Dean or Medical Director (NIMDTA and HEIW where the Medical Director is the RO) and
                that Health Education England (HEE), NHS Education for Scotland (NES), HEIW or the
                Northern Ireland Medical and Dental Training Agency (NIMDTA) is my designated body.
              </li>
              <li>
                If starting at F1 level, I will have achieved a primary medical qualification as
                recognised by the GMC and obtained provisional registration by the time I am
                scheduled to commence the F1 year. I understand that I will need to obtain full
                registration with the GMC in advance of commencing as a F2 doctor.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will ensure that when carrying out work in a general practice setting, I am on the
                GP Performers List (specialty trainees only).
              </li>
              <li>
                I agree that I will only assume responsibility for or perform procedures in areas
                where I have sufficient knowledge, experience and expertise as set out by the GMC,
                my employers and my clinical supervisors.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will have adequate insurance and indemnity cover, in accordance with GMC guidance.
                I understand that personal indemnity cover is also strongly recommended.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will inform my Responsible Officer, HEE/NES/HEIW/NIMDTA and my employer
                immediately if I am currently under investigation by the police, the GMC/General
                Dental Council (GDC), NHS Resolution (formerly the National Clinical Assessment
                Service) or other regulatory body, and I will inform my Responsible Officer and
                HEE/NES/HEIW/NIMDTA if I am under investigation by my employer. I also agree to
                share information on the progress of any investigations.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will inform my Responsible Officer, HEE/NES/HEIW/NIMDTA and my employer
                immediately if the MTPS or GMC/GDC place any conditions (interim or otherwise) on my
                licence, or if my name is suspended or erased/removed from the Medical or Dental
                Register/Performers List, or if NHS England take action to restrict my ability to
                work as a doctor or a dentist.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will provide my employer and HEE/NES/HEIW/NIMDTA with adequate notice as per GMC
                guidance/contract requirements if I wish to resign from my post/training programme.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will maintain a prescribed connection with HEE/NES/HEIW/NIMDTA, work in an
                approved practice setting until my GMC revalidation date (this applies to all
                doctors granted full registration after 2 June 2014) and comply with all
                requirements regarding the GMC revalidation process.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will ensure that I comply with the standards required from doctors when engaging
                with social media, and I will adhere to my employerâ€™s policy on social media and GMC
                guidance.

                I acknowledge that as an employee in a healthcare organisation, I accept the

                and departmental inductions, and workplace-based appraisal as well as educational
                appraisal. I acknowledge and agree to the need to share information about my
                performance as a doctor in training with other organisations (e.g. employers,
                medical schools, the GMC, Colleges/training bodies involved in my training) and with
                the Postgraduate Dean on a regular basis.

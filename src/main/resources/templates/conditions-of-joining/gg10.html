                agree to meet the following requirements throughout the duration of the programme:
              </dd>
            </div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I will always have at the forefront of my clinical and professional practice the
                principles of Good Medical Practice for the benefit of safe patient care. I am aware
                that Good Medical Practice requires me to keep my knowledge and skills up to date
                throughout my working life, and to regularly take part in educational activities
                that maintain and further develop my capabilities, competence and performance.
              </li>
              <li>
                As a postgraduate doctor in training, I will make myself familiar with my curriculum
                and meet the requirements set within it. I will use the available training resources
                optimally to develop my knowledge, skills and attitudes to the standards set by the
                relevant curriculum. This will include additional requirements as set out by the
                relevant curriculum.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will ensure that the care I give to patients is responsive to their needs, and
                that it is equitable, respects human rights, challenges discrimination, promotes
                equality, and maintains the dignity of patients and carers.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will ensure that I treat my clinical and non-clinical colleagues with respect,
                promoting a culture of teamworking across all professions working in healthcare.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will maintain my General Medical Council (GMC) registration with a licence to
                practise (even if temporarily out of programme). For all postgraduate doctors in
                training, failure to do so may result in a police investigation, immediate
                suspension from employment and referral to the GMC. Failure to do so may also result
                in my removal from the training programme.
              </li>
              <li>
                I understand my responsibilities within revalidation, that I must declare my full
                scope of practice (including locum positions) and that I will provide evidence for
                all areas of activity using Form R (Part B) to inform the Annual Review of
                Competence Progression panel and Responsible Officer (RO) of my full scope of
                practice. I understand that my RO is the Postgraduate Dean (or the Medical Director
                in Health Education and Improvement Wales (HEIW), and the Northern Ireland Medical
                and Dental Training Agency (NIMDTA)), and that NHS England Workforce, Training and
                Education (NHSE WTE), NHS Education for Scotland (NES), HEIW or NIMDTA is my
                designated body.
              </li>
              <li>
                I agree that I will only assume responsibility for or perform procedures in areas
                where I have sufficient knowledge, experience and expertise as set out by the GMC,
                my employers and my clinical supervisors.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will have adequate insurance and indemnity cover, in accordance with GMC guidance.
                I understand that personal indemnity cover is also strongly recommended.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will inform my RO, NHSE WTE/NES/HEIW/NIMDTA and my employer immediately if I am
                currently under investigation by the police, the GMC/General Dental Council (GDC),
                NHS Resolution or other regulatory body, and I will inform my RO and NHSE
                WTE/NES/HEIW/NIMDTA if I am under investigation by my employer. I also agree to
                share information on the progress of any investigations.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will inform my RO, NHSE WTE/NES/HEIW/NIMDTA and my employer immediately if the
                Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service or GMC/GDC place any conditions (interim or
                otherwise) on my licence, or if I am suspended or erased/removed from the medical or
                dental register/Performers List, or if NHSE WTE/NES/HEIW/NIMDTA takes action to
                restrict my ability to work as a doctor or a dentist.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will provide my employer and NHSE WTE/NES/HEIW/NIMDTA with adequate notice as per
                GMC guidance/contract requirements if I wish to resign from my post/training
                programme.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will maintain a prescribed connection with NHSE WTE/NES/HEIW/NIMDTA, work in an
                approved practice setting until my GMC revalidation date (this applies to all
                doctors granted full registration after 2 June 2014) and comply with all
                requirements regarding the GMC revalidation process.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will ensure that I comply with the standards required from doctors when engaging
                with social media, and I will adhere to my employerâ€™s policy on social media and GMC
                guidance.
              </li>
              <li>
                I acknowledge that as an employee in a healthcare organisation, I accept the
                responsibility to abide by Good Medical Practice and work effectively as an employee
                for that organisation; this includes familiarity with policies (including absence
                policies) as well as participating in pre-employment checks and occupational health
                assessments, employer/departmental inductions, and workplace-based appraisal and
                educational appraisal. I acknowledge and agree to the need to share information
                about my performance as a postgraduate doctor in training with other organisations
                (e.g. employers, medical schools, the GMC and Colleges/training bodies involved in
                my training) and with the Postgraduate Dean on a regular basis.
